# Important Disclaimer Regarding Academic Integrity Violations
This repository is solely intended as a backup of my personal work. I am not and have never been affiliated with Stanford, but you should pay attention if you are formally registered for this course in a university.

Academic plagarism is a serious issue in most U.S. universities, so please do not: 
    1. Copy any source code into your own assignments 
    2. Use the same source code logic but change variable names, loop types, and statement orders, etc. 
    3. Plagiarize in any other way

By looking at this web page, you have agreed that you will not violate any academic integrity policies. You are presumed to have agreed that you will be the only one reponsible for any potential violations of your institution's academic policies. I will not be responsible for any penalties.

I will also not be held responsible by any academic institutions for violating their academic policies or providing unsolicited assistance to their students.
