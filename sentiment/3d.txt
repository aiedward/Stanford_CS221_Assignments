This document provides response to Question 3d.

Analysis of incorrect predictions:

1. === home alone goes hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even steven spielberg would know how to do . besides , real movie producers aren't this nice .
Truth: -1, Prediction: 1 [WRONG]

    Reason for error: This review is clearly sarcastic with quite a few positive words, such as "funny", "real", "nice", etc, which could have confused the predictor.

    The classifier needs to use phrases rather than single words as features to "understand" the sarcastic reviews that sometimes use positive words.

2. === a heady , biting , be-bop ride through nighttime manhattan , a loquacious videologue of the modern male and the lengths to which he'll go to weave a protective cocoon around his own ego 
Truth: 1, Prediction: -1 [WRONG]

    Reason for error: This review uses too many rare words such that they were not learned from the training sample.

    To fix this, the classifier needs example reviews containing these words.

3. === 'it's painful to watch witherspoon's talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like legally blonde and sweet home abomination , i mean , alabama . '
Truth: -1, Prediction: 1 [WRONG]

    Reason for error: It appears that the movie names contain positive words with heavy weights, such as sweet, films, home, etc.

    If we were provided with the names of all movies, we could filter them out.

4. === wickedly funny , visually engrossing , never boring , this movie challenges us to think about the ways we consume pop culture .
Truth: 1, Prediction: -1 [WRONG]

    Reason for error: Context wasn't taken into account so that e.g. "never boring" drags the score down a lot whilst it's actually a positive phrase.

    If we also take phrases as features it would improve the predictions in this situation.

5. === patchy combination of soap opera , low-tech magic realism and , at times , ploddingly sociological commentary .
Truth: -1, Prediction: 1 [WRONG]

    Reason for error: Context was not taken into account, some rare words weren't learned in the first place but they convey a lot of meaning.

    We could provide more training samples containing those rare words, and extract more features such as phrases.

6. === only in its final surprising shots does rabbit-proof fence find the authority it's looking for .
Truth: -1, Prediction: 1 [WRONG]

    Reason for error: This review doesn't have adjectives describing directly how the movie is. It is using an analog/something in the movie to convey how ridiculous the plot is.

    The prediction in the case can be improved by having more training samples.

7. === alternative medicine obviously has its merits . . . but ayurveda does the field no favors .
Truth: -1, Prediction: 1 [WRONG]

    Reason: The review uses "but" to make a turn in its attitude.

    We should extract phrases containing "but" and the words following it.

8. === no screen fantasy-adventure in recent memory has the showmanship of clones' last 45 minutes .
Truth: 1, Prediction: -1 [WRONG]

    Reason: Positive words such as fantasy-adventure and showmenship were not learned.

    We need more training samples. Also, we need to split the dash to make two separate words, which are more likely to have been learned.

9. o ótimo esforço do diretor acaba sendo frustrado pelo roteiro , que , depois de levar um bom tempo para colocar a trama em andamento , perde-se de vez a partir do instante em que os estranhos acontecimentos são explicados .
Truth: -1, Prediction: 1 [WRONG]

    Reason: The vast majority of the training samples are in English, while this review is in Spanish. As a result, most of the words' weights were not learned at all.

    We need to have more training samples in Spanish.

10. === this may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer's coming-of-age .
Truth: -1, Prediction: 1 [WRONG]

    Reason: The very last few words are about the content of the movie, but most of them are positive. However, they have no impact on the overall positiveness of the review.

    We could include phrases consist of "about" and the words following it.
